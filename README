A lightweight minor mode for automatically inserting typographical
quotation marks.

The variable `smartish-double-quote-left' defines the string that
will be used as the left-double-quote.

The variable `smartish-double-quote-right' defines the string that
will be used as the right-double-quote.

The variable `smartish-single-quote-left' defines the string that
will be used as the left-single-quote.

The variable `smartish-single-quote-right' defines the string that
will be used as the right-single-quote.

==LIMITATIONS==

This is really only designed to handle double-quoting styles
automatically and so only provides a paired insert function for single
quotes.
